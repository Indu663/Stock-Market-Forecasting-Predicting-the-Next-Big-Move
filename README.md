üìà Stock Market Forecasting: Predicting the Next Big Move
Stock market forecasting is a highly complex and dynamic challenge in the domains of data science and finance. This project aims to develop an intelligent forecasting system that can predict future stock prices or market movements based on historical market data using advanced time-series analysis and machine learning techniques.

üß† Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build predictive models that analyze past stock market data and forecast future stock price trends or movements. These models are expected to recognize temporal patterns and generate valuable insights to assist in investment decisions, such as identifying price increases, decreases, or predicting volatility.

üìä Techniques & Models Used
To effectively forecast stock prices, we employ a range of classical and deep learning-based time-series forecasting techniques:

Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

Traditional statistical model suited for linear time-series forecasting.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to handle long-term dependencies in sequential data.

Prophet (by Facebook)

A robust model for trend and seasonality forecasting, particularly effective with noisy time-series data.

Statistical Methods

Including Moving Averages, Rolling Mean, and Exponential Smoothing for trend analysis and baseline comparisons.

üîÅ Project Workflow
Data Collection & Loading

Historical stock price data (e.g., daily open, close, high, low, volume) is loaded from CSV files.

Preprocessing & Cleaning

Handling missing values, normalization/scaling, and transforming the data for model compatibility.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualization of trends, seasonality, price movements, and volatility analysis.

Feature Engineering

Creating lag features, rolling statistics, and time-based indices for enhanced model input.

Model Development

Implementing ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet, and statistical models to generate forecasts.

Model Evaluation

Accuracy measured using metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

Forecasting & Visualization

Displaying predicted vs. actual stock prices, trend lines, and confidence intervals.

üìå Output
Predicted stock prices or indices over future time horizons (e.g., next day, next 7 days).

Graphical plots comparing actual vs. predicted values.
